    <string name="bio"> Hi. I am Ainur.\n\nI’m a Machine Learning Engineer currently trying to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.\n\n I used to write academic papers about deep learning and how it compares to machine learning when I was a grad student.
\n\nIn my spare time, I’m training machine to detect faces using Computer Vision. I have to wear makeup on those days so it won’t judge me.
\n\nWhen I’m bored, I’ll talk to the chatbot I’m developing using LSTM.
\n\nI also do sentiment analysis on reviews, because let’s face it, I’m as clueless as my chatbot when detecting emotions.
\n\nIf my training model is well-behaved, I might believe them when they recommend me a restaurant\n\n.
